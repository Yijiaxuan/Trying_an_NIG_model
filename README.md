Task1–7 represent the first stage of Experiment 1, where the NIG model is gradually constructed.
“Trying State Space Model” corresponds to the second stage of Experiment 1, in which the previously built NIG model is replaced with Jackman’s state-space model.
“Simulated data” contains the script for Experiment 2, where “Sim_Jackman_S1” corresponds to Scenario A and “Sim_Jackman_S2” corresponds to Scenario B.
